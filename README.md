# clipse-beat
Inspired by javascript30. When working on the drum kit project, the song Grindin’ by The Clipse came to my head. I just wanted to make something fun and nostalgic that my peers and music enthusiasts can appreciate.

<h2>Desktop only for now</h2>

Here was the checklist for this project: 

- Extract drum sounds from audio editor
- Randomize backgrounds
- Change to NERD font
- Add title and footer
- Make mobile friendly
- Make touch responsive
- Upload to AWS

<h3>Thoughts</h3>

There is a latency issue for the mobile ux that I’m trying to find a fix for. My biggest challenge was trying to make the page mobile friendly but the latency makes it practically unusable on iOS, Chrome on Android is functional but it isn’t the best experience.

This project helped me learn more about touch events and eventlisteners, brush off my css rust and jogged my memory about styling for mobile viewing. I'm glad got this project out of my mind and into reality. I hope when people use this it brings back memories and hopefully create new ones.
