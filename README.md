# clipse-beat
Inspired by javascript30. When working on the drum kit project, the song Grindin’ by The Clipse came to my head. I just wanted to make something fun and nostalgic that my peers and music enthusiasts can appreciate.

Here was the checklist for this project: 

- Extracted drum sounds from audio editor
- Randomized backgrounds
- Changed to NERD font
- Add title and footer
- Make mobile friendly
- Make touch responsive
- Upload to AWS

Thoughts

There is a latency issue for the mobile ux that I’m trying to find a fix for. My biggest challenge was trying to make the page mobile friendly but the latency makes it practically unusable on iOS, Chrome on Android is functional but it isn’t the best experience.
